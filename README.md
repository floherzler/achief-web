This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install packages.
Note: I had to manually downgrade to react 18.2 for zustand to install.

```bash
npm install appwrite node-appwrite zustand immer
```

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button card input label popover avatar badge
```
